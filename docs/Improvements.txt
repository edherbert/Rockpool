--Ideas for Improvements--

The position of the cursor in the terrain edit tool should not change when sculpting.
Maybe only change the position of the cursor when the mouse moves, then re-do the ray.

Possibly see if updating select areas of the terrain is better than doing the entire thing,
this might speed up the running of the application.
