--Objects in the hierarchy--
The hierarchy will store references to the objects in the scene.
This will be stored in the object data, rather than a separate list.
It's important that each item knows where it should go, especially given how the actions can also be redone.

So for now, I think the plan is this. Objects should only be detached when they are deleted.
This means the action can be easily undone if necessary, as the object would just have to be re-attached if needed again.
When the command expires, the object can then be deleted.
So undoing an action like the add event would just require detaching the object, but remembering where it went.

I'm probably going to have to add a pointer to the object in the item struct.
This is because commands like the delete command operate on lots of objects.
Again, I would just have to detach the base item's objects, but I would still need pointers for the re-creation of the items.

So when each new item is appended, I can pass the data in that basically just holds a pointer to the object.
