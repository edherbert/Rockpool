--Objects in the hierarchy--
The hierarchy will store references to the objects in the scene.
This will be stored in the object data, rather than a separate list.
It's important that each item knows where it should go, especially given how the actions can also be redone.

So for now, I think the plan is this. Objects should only be detached when they are deleted.
This means the action can be easily undone if necessary, as the object would just have to be re-attached if needed again.
When the command expires, the object can then be deleted.
So undoing an action like the add event would just require detaching the object, but remembering where it went.

I'm probably going to have to add a pointer to the object in the item struct.
This is because commands like the delete command operate on lots of objects.
Again, I would just have to detach the base item's objects, but I would still need pointers for the re-creation of the items.

So when each new item is appended, I can pass the data in that basically just holds a pointer to the object.

--Moving entities--
I want to start work on the entity move command.
This basically would work by selecting an item and then pushing a key, for example the M key.
Then as the user moves the mouse, the item would move with it.
They can also specify an axis to move the item on

This will also be a command, but I'm not entirely sure where the command should go.
It should probably go in the map class, because that's running a check function for input.
I suppose I'll have quite a few move commands by the time I'm done.

--Duplicating items--
So the way that duplicating items works is pretty straight forward.
You have to create a copy constructor for the object, which is basically just a constructor that takes in a reference to the object that needs to be copied.
The constructor can then go through the object and pull all the information from it to copy itself.
So as for the duplication command, it shouldn't be too difficult.

The copy command is probably going to have to duplicate the item again, and store that in the command manager or something.
When a paste function is needed, the item can be copied again and just pasted into that new place.
Furthermore, objects will have to inherit this copy method so that it can be performed correctly.
