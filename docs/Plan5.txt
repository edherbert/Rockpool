--Rockpool design--
I've been thinking for the past little while about how other aspects of Rockpool will work.
For example, how will the terrains work for things like indoor scenes?
Should all the terrains be grouped together, or separated in some way?
How should the layering work?


-Indoor Scenes-
Indoor scenes aren't really based around terrain.
They use a modular system of identical sized assets that can be used to make any sort of shape.
So for example, you might have a corner piece of wall, as well as a normal flat piece of wall.
These wall pieces could be placed together to create an indoor scene.
These pieces are to be a universal size, so for example one metre by one metre.
This would allow all the pieces to easily stack together and make up practically any indoor scene you could want.

This conflicts with the terrain system I have at the moment.
Rockpool makes the user have a terrain in their scene, the user could probably do with a choice as to whether they need it or not.
Realistically, there is nothing stopping the user from adding terrains in any scene.
With this in mind, it might be better to separate the terrains, so put them in different terrain groups per terrain and so on.

-Separated terrains-
It might be better to use a system like unity, where items are put into the scene and can be placed in any location.
This would mean that the terrain is not a neccesity and can be used in any way, almost like an object in the game.
This would give me much more freedom with regards to the objects in the world, as I wouldn't have to have a terrain to put the objects onto.

-How should the layering work-
I suppose there won't be layers.
It'll just use the standard hierarchy system that I see in most editors, although I'll do some things differently.
Firstly, I can't just export the entire thing in a single file.
For example, the overworld will have a huge number of entities in it, I can't just export them all in one file.

What I could do is export them based on their position in the world.
So if the entities are between 0 and 1000 x and y then export them in one file.
So basically export them in blocks of 1000, depending on their location.
This size could be configured by the user.

I can think of some potential problems with this.
Firstly, what would happen to an entity who's parent is in another chunk?
If the parent's chunk is unloaded, then what would happen to the child?
I think the best way to handle this would be to forget about both the child and the parent.
If a parent node is un-loaded then all it's children are as well.

-Does this mean that a single node could have two terrain chunks?
    Yes I suppose it could. There is no reason why this might be a bad thing.
    The user should be sure however that if each terrain is 1000 by 1000 that they line up properly.

-Where will the terrain tools go if the terrain is changing like this?
    I'll probably leave them where they are. I like a toolbar.
    I'll have to make it so that the user can't edit multiple terrains with a single tool stroke though.

-What's going to happen to the terrain information interface?
    I should probably group them together into their own thing.
    So if you click on an entity, you'll be shown information specific to that entity.
    So if you click on the terrain, you'll be shown information relative to the terrain.


--More thinking--
The problem I have at the moment is a lot of the user interface needs to change.
I'm going to have to implement the object hierarchy panel, which will contain the information about the objects in the scene.
I'm almost not sure if I'll need something like the terrain tools panel.

The user will probably edit the terrain by clicking on the terrain and changing it's values in the inspector.
This would be pretty similar to how unity works.
The inspector will contain all the information about the object that's currently selected.
If that's the case, I'm not really sure how I'm going to need the tools in a tool panel. It might just be easier to put them in the inspector.
However, this is something for the future, for now the most important part is planning out how the entities will work.
It'll probably be a good idea to merge the command branch back to the master branch.

--Plan for now--
There are a few factors that are going to have to change a bit to accomadate for the new design.
With the new design, I'm going to have to re-name a few things, and re-design other things.

I'm still going to keep calling Rockpool a map editor.

Basically, everything that can be placed in the world inherits from object, which is a class.
Each object can be placed at a position, and parented to any other object.
Objects could be anything, ranging from a cube to something like terrain (terrain can't be scaled or rotated).

There will be a hierarchy of objects, this is used to view the objects which the user currently has in their scene.
The user can use this to select objects and re-arrange their order.
Objects inherit the scale, rotation and position based on their parents.

There will also be the object inspector.
This will contain the relevant information about the currently selected object.
This would change depending on what type of object is selected.
So if a mesh is selected it would show the material information about that specific mesh.
If a piece of terrain is selected then it will show the terrain information, as well as the terrain tool information.

Finally, the resource browser will contain information about the resources that the user has at their disposal.
This could be things like meshes, images, materials and so on.
This will also contain prefabs when they are implemented.
To place something into the map, the user simply has to drag it into the render window.

So with this in mind, the main aspects of the program are:
    The object hierarchy
    The resource browser
    The object information panel

This means that there are a few aspects of the current system that need to be changed.
firstly, the terrain info panel and the tool panel will need to change.
This change will probably be getting rid of them more than anything. However, I won't be doing that for a long time.
I don't really want to remove features before I have features to replace them with, so for now they are staying.

From here I need to plan out how the classes will interact with each other.
Quite a few classes will need to change, for example the terrain class.
They need to be planned out before anything is implemented.

Here is a list of things to think about:
    -How will the gui for the inspector work? Will it all be there like the terrain layers panel, or will they be created as they go along.
    -Will there be things like components in the inspector?
    -How will storing items in the scene work? Will ogre handle the entire thing or will each object have it's pointer stored(probably the latter)
    -How will the object inheritance work? Will the objects inherit from object them mesh then terrain or whatever.
    -How will saving prefabs work (Will the prefabs be saved relative to the one map or the entire program)
        -If relative to the map, will they be exported along with the rest of the map.


--Info panel--
It's important that the information panel contains information that's useful to the user.
The question is should it contain all the gui components or should some of them be created / destroyed when needed.
Ultimately, I think it would be best if I had a handler that managed the individual information boxes.

Each object will have a component section, but that does not mean that each object will have a material section.
For example, I don't think the terrain will have a material section.
This does not mean that the material section needs to be removed, it just means it should be hidden.

The best idea for this might be a system where you have a handler for each individual information section.
So for example, you would have a positionInformationHandler for the position and scale and everything, and then a terrainInformationHandler for the terrains.
These handlers would then contain functions to show or hide them, as well as setting their values if the selection is changed.

I could also have an informationPanelHandler that manages which handlers to show.
This would probably contain a vector, and a function in which the type of item could be passed.

There is no guarantee that I won't want to add more components to the information panel. This would allow me to do that.
I'll implement that panel once I have things to add to it.

--How items will be stored--
Thinking about it, I really don't think it would be a good idea to let ogre store all the items.
I think I'm going to need simple classes that contain mostly pointers to handle that sort of thing.
So I'll have an object class which contains a pointer to an ogre entity and probably a pointer to it's parent and child (if it has one).
This would mostly just be in the object class, of course, each item will inherit other bits as well.
For example, the terrain will extend to a terrainObject, which will contain all the terrain functions.

I'm also going to have a terrain manager, which will store all the terrains (and the terrain group).
This can be incharge of saving the terrains and so on.

The map class will be used to interface with all these components, so it will store all the objects in the map, and provide an easy way to get to them.
It will be in charge of handling input requests, such as terrain edits, regardless of which canvas was used.

--Future classes--

Main - In charge of handling the map files. This is where you would go to load or save a map
Map - The current map. This will contain information about the objects in the map and also be the interface to handle input on the map.
CanvasHandler - This will handle all the canvases that the user has created. This will be where the user can render a canvas, or get it's input
Canvas - This is the individual canvas. Canvases check their own mouse position and click input.

Object - This contains basic information about the object including pointers to the current scene node and parent and child nodes.
    It will also contain interface functions to control the node.
    This class will not assume that the object has anything to render, it will largely just represent a scene node.
meshObject - Inherited from the object class, this will contain information about meshes in particular.
    This one does assume that there is something to render, it's similar to an entity in ogre.
lightObject - An object that represents a light
terrainObject - An object which represents a chunk of terrain, needs to be managed by the terrain manager.

terrainManager - Manages the chunks of terrain. Responsible for saving and loading terrain.

HierarchyManager - Provides a display of the map hierarchy. This will provide an interface to tell the map which objects are currently selected.
InfoManager - This will provide information about the object(s) that is currently selected.
InfoComponent - This will be an individual panel that will appear on the infoManager, for example the position of the item.



--Object handling--
By storing the scene node of the object, you can get the other scene nodes, but not the object.
The best thing to do would probably be to store the parent object as a pointer and the child objects as a pointer vector.

I'm not sure of the best way to store the objects in the map though.
Maybe I could number all the entities in the list. That would allow me to do a binary search rather than just checking them all.
However, there are times when I think the objects might not align. For example, what if they are moved.
If I store all the objects as a flat vector pointer list then I might not even need to re-arrange them.

It might be worth seeing how the tree ctrl handles ids.
I might be able to store the id of the tree item in the object.
This would pretty much allow me to search through the list and find the item in question.

So it turns out that you can store data within the tree ctrl, for each individual member of the tree.
You kind of have to inherit it and do it that way, but this should allow me to store a pointer to the object within the tree node.
Then, within the object I can store a pointer to the tree node.
This will completely avoid the entire searching the array thing.
I'm not even sure if I need that vector in the map class to store all the objects after all.

How would the hierarchy know which objects are in the map when it begins.
It would read in the file from the user and then turn that into a map.
As it goes it would create the objects, and then it would create the node in the tree hierarchy.
The node would then have a reference to the object, and the object to the node.
If the node was removed, the object could be as well, and visa versa.

--How objects work--
An object is just a wrapper for the scene node.
This means that it should come with a load of functions to attach objects together.
