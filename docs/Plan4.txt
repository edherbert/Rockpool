--Resource Manager--

The resource manager will be one of the most crucial aspects of the finished product.
It will allow the user to control which objects are placed in the world, as well as be given a view as to what objects they could place.
Ogre handles the majority of the resource management, but there are some things that still need to be thought about

Resource locations are added to the map through the map settings section.
Locations can be removed and added when needed, although if an entity is using a resource that corresponds to that resource location then the user will be warned.
If the resource location is removed then the entities that are using that object will have their models replaced with something generic.

If the user is attempting to add a location that contains a conflicting resource, the location will be rejected
The user will be shown a pop-up warning them about what they are trying to do and which resources conflict.


The resource manager will come with a pane that contains the resources in a grid-like fashion.
When the user is using the entity placing tool, they will be able to choose a resource from this list to place.
Eventually, if the user double-clicks on a resource they will be shown a popup of it running in a window.
Furthermore, each resource should contain a thumbnail.


Here are the aspects of the resource manager:
    -A manager for handling thumbnails, each resource shouldn't have to have it's thumbnail re-generated each time a new one is needed
    -A window to return the name of a resource when it is clicked on.
