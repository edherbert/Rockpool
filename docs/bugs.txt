--BUGS--

The contents of the canvas is only initialised when the first call to paint is made.
Maybe call that at some point because initialising the canvas should be one of the first things to do.
This includes terrain, as when creating a new map the terrain is not generated until the first draw.

The loading screen for loading and creating maps doesn't work. I've disabled it for now but maybe try and get it to work at some point.

Possible bug:
    The size of the terrain might be changing dependent on how many terrains there are.
    Posssibly a terrain of 3000 will be 3000 if there is only one, but 1500 if there is two.
    Check whether terrain size counts for the terrain or the world (cos it should count for each terrain)
    TURNS OUT
        The first terrain chunk starts it's centre at 0, so that's why it was off.
