--BUGS--

The contents of the canvas is only initialised when the first call to paint is made.
Maybe call that at some point because initialising the canvas should be one of the first things to do.
This includes terrain, as when creating a new map the terrain is not generated until the first draw.

The loading screen for loading and creating maps doesn't work. I've disabled it for now but maybe try and get it to work at some point.

Removing all the locations from the location manager and then trying to select something in the browser after adding more crashes it.

Editing the sides of the terrains has some weird effects. So weird you can't undo them.

Using the terrain texture tool at a small size and then trying to paint over it leads to some blotches.

When dragging a hierarchy item backwards, the index goes slightly out of sync.
This is because the item has been dragged backwards, it's item now represents an index, so it always ends up one behind where it should be.

Sometimes, when dragging items they are reversed in order.
This is all to do with dragging items backwards.

Possible bug:
    The size of the terrain might be changing dependent on how many terrains there are.
    Posssibly a terrain of 3000 will be 3000 if there is only one, but 1500 if there is two.
    Check whether terrain size counts for the terrain or the world (cos it should count for each terrain)
    TURNS OUT
        The first terrain chunk starts it's centre at 0, so that's why it was off.
